# Amino-Acid-Histogram
Assignment description:

The focus of this assignment is on DNA and Bioinformatics. You will want to keep the
corresponding lecture notes handy as they will elucidate key aspects of this assignment. The
completed program will support two main features: a histogram displaying the amino acids
produced by a particular DNA sequence and an implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch
algorithm for global pairwise sequence alignment.

To help you get started on the assignment, I have already provided some of the basic glue code
to get a window up and running. You will have to add some wxWidgets code during the course
of the assignment, but the majority of the code you will write is related to the backend
functionality, which does not rely on wxWidgets in any way.
